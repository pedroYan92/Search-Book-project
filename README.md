##A simple project using the public API from Google Books

In this project it's possible make simple querys of books from google API through
an input field.

The results gonna come up simultaneously as you type in the input field with the follow data:

- Book cover;
- Book title;
- Author name;
- Published date;

This project was made with pure javascript, html and css.

The goal with this simple project is practicing the call API with Fetch method in javascript.

OBS: the project is looking rustic, needs some improvements in the CSS styles that I intend to do it very soon.
